# Diit-College-Andriod-Application
Andriod Application for College of Digital Innovation Technology (Year: 2019)

Duo project with my friend Thanawit In-um!

This Project application was created for College of Digital Innovation Technology (DIIT), Rangsit University

We used Android Studio (JAVA), Firebase Database, MPAndroidChart, Firebase Cloud Messaging and Google maps API.

It is an application that collects information about the college such as 
 - News
 - History
 - Major & Course in Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree and Doctor's Degree
 - Highlight
 - Professor in each major
 - Quiz for preliminary analysis that which major is the user suitable for. It will be considered based on the user's quiz answers that they have aptitude and preferences and also collect statistics to show it in graph form.
 - Administrator can broadcast messages about news or notifications to users who have this application (use Firebase Cloud Messaging)
 - User can direct call and email to administrator for problem or ask for more information.
